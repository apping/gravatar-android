gravatar-android
================

A lightweight Java Gravatar library optimized for Android.

Usage
================

Gravatar-android features a simple and fluid API. It fully supports Gravatar image requests as
described in the official documentation: http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/images/ and automatically computes
the request URL.

    String gravatarUrl = Gravatar.init().with(user.email).force404().size(Gravatar.MAX_IMAGE_SIZE_PIXEL).build();
    
Using the awesome [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) from Square, you can populate your AbsListView with
your users' faces in one line of code (usually in BaseAdapter.getView()).

    Picasso.with(mContext)
           .load(gravatarUrl)
           .into((ImageView) convertView.findViewById(R.id.user_avatar));
            
You can have a look at the sample app for a more complete implementation.

If you need to, you can provide the library with other default params by creating your own instance of Gravatar
using the build-in Gravatar.Builder class. In this case, the recommanded approach
is to store the resulting Gravatar object as a singleton in your application.

    Gravatar myGravatar = new Gravatar.Builder().ssl().build();
    String gravatarUrl = myGravatar.with(user.email).build();

Download
================

You can download the 
[latest JAR](https://github.com/tkeunebr/gravatar-android/blob/master/gravatar-android-sample/libs/gravatar-android-1.0.jar) 
used in the sample app and add it as a dependency to your project. I'll be happy to consider and review each of your
pull requests.
